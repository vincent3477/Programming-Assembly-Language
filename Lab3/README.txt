CRUZID: vsiu2
Lab no. and description: Lab3. The purpose of this lab was to learn how to code (nested) loops using RISC-V and utilize registers, and functions as provided by RARS. 
Concepts used from this include: branching, conditionals, looping, ecalls, macros, usage of registers, functions (i.e. addi). 
Files: Lab3.asm
    The Lab3.asm file asks the user for an INTEGER input, and the output will contain a line of stars, asterisks, and a number.
More specifically, it will asks the user for the number of rows, and the program will print the row of stars and asterisks incrementally and an odd number 
at the end until the height of the pattern has been reached. To run the file, it must be assembled, then the client can run the program, which it goes to what
the file is intended to do.
